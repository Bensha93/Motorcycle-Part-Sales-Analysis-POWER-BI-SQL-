## üìå SQL Highlights

**Monthly Sales Summary:**

```sql
SELECT  
    MONTH(date) AS month_sales,  
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity)) AS Total_Sales  
FROM motorcycle_part_sales  
GROUP BY MONTH(date);
```

**MoM Growth Calculation:**

```sql
SELECT  
    MONTH(date) AS month,  
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * quantity)) AS total_sales,  
    (SUM(unit_price * quantity) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 1)  
     OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(date))) / LAG(SUM(unit_price * quantity), 1)  
     OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(date)) * 100 AS mom_increase_percentage  
FROM motorcycle_part_sales  
GROUP BY MONTH(date);
```
